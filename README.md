# SpoonDetectorOptOut

I am so tired of people missing the idea of opensource software. SpoonDetectorOptOut will be for server creators who wish to opt-out of a patch which will ruin their server, take away their creative freedom and hinder development of opensource software.

The original code here for now simply as a placeholder and so we can review it and create a fix for this issue.
